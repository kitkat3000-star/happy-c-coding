                <p class="intro">
                    This page showcases my journey with the C programming language. I worked on these projects
                    for my algorithms and data structures class. Here, you'll find a collection of projects 
                    where I've applied core C concepts like memory management, pointers, and structured 
                    programming. Each project reflects my problem-solving approach and growing expertise 
                    in low-level programming.
                </p>

                    <h2> 1. Simple dictionary using a linked list in C </h2>

                        <img src="./images/linked-list.png" alt="linked list">
                    </div>
                    <h3> What is a Linked List??</h3>
                    <h4>The Train of Data üöÇ</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you‚Äôre at a train station, and instead of one long train, 
                        there are train cars connected one after another. Each car has two things:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Passengers (data): The information stored in that train car.</li>
                        <li>A connection to the next train car: A link that tells where the next car is.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>But here‚Äôs the twist: Unlike a normal train where you can easily go to the 
                        previous car, a basic Linked List only knows where the next car is! If you 
                        want to reach the last car, you have to start from the front and move one by one.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Types of Linked Lists:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Singly Linked List: The train moves forward only (each car only links to the 
                            next one).</li>
                        <li>Doubly Linked List: The train can move forward and backward (each car links 
                            to both the next and previous ones).</li>
                        <li>Circular Linked List: The train is infinite! The last car links back to the 
                            first one.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>My project</h3>
                    <p>I created a simple dictionary using a <a href="https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list" target="_blank">
                        linked list</a> in C to store information from a dataset about the City of Melbourne. 
                        This dictionary allowed users to search for footpath information using attributes 
                        from the dataset as keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To build the dictionary, I read data from a file and inserted each footpath record 
                        as a node in a linked list. Additionally, I implemented a method to search for a
                        key within the list and output any matching records. Since keys were not guaranteed 
                        to be unique, multiple records could be retrieved for a single search.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>2. PR quadtree </h2>
                    <div class="image-container">

                    </div>
                    <h3>What is a PR Quadtree??</h3>
                    <h4>The City Map of Data üó∫Ô∏è</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you‚Äôre looking at a map of a city, and you want to organize it efficiently. 
                        Instead of storing every single location individually, you divide the map into four regions. 
                        Each of these regions can be further split into four smaller regions, just like zooming into a digital map.</p>
                
                    <p>This is how a Point Region (PR) Quadtree works! It breaks down space into four quadrants
                        whenever there are multiple points in the same area, helping efficiently store and search spatial data.</p>
                
                    <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each node represents a region. If there are too many points in one region, 
                            it splits into four smaller regions.</li>
                        <li>Each region can contain at most one point. If a new point is added in an 
                            occupied region, it divides further.</li>
                        <li>The tree grows dynamically. Only areas with data are divided, keeping memory 
                            usage efficient.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>Applications of PR Quadtrees:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>üó∫Ô∏è Geographical Mapping: Used in GPS and mapping applications.</li>
                        <li>üéÆ Game Development: Helps manage large game worlds efficiently.</li>
                        <li>üîç Spatial Searching: Quickly finds objects in 2D space.</li>
                        <li>üõ∞Ô∏è Image Processing: Used in image compression and terrain modeling.</li>
                    </ul>
                  
                    <h3>My project</h3>
                    <p>I implemented a <a href="https://jimkang.com/quadtreevis/" target="_blank">PR quadtree</a> to store 
                        and search for data points efficiently, this was an extension to the previous city of 
                        Melbourne data assignment. 
                        The implementation supported inserting data points, searching for individual points, 
                        and retrieving all points within a query rectangle. 
                        For insertion, if the tree was empty and the point was within bounds, it became the root. 
                        Otherwise, I recursively traversed the tree to find the correct position. If a black 
                        leaf already contained a point, I split it into four children, continuing until the new 
                        and existing points occupied separate black leaf nodes.
                    </p> 
                        
                    <p>For searching, I traversed the tree, selecting child nodes based on the point's 
                        location. If found, the associated information was returned; otherwise, the search 
                        indicated the point was not stored. 
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>For range queries, I recursively checked which child nodes overlapped with the query 
                        rectangle, retrieving points from all black leaf nodes within the specified area.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm??</h3>
                    <h4>The GPS of Shortest Paths üó∫Ô∏è</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you‚Äôre in a city with many roads, and you need to find the shortest route from your house to a friend‚Äôs place. 
                    Instead of randomly guessing which way to go, you use a GPS that calculates the quickest route based on distance. 
                    That‚Äôs exactly what Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm does in the world of graphs.</p>
                
                    <p>This algorithm finds the shortest path from one starting point to all other points in a network, 
                    just like a GPS finds the fastest way to multiple locations.</p>
                
                    <h4>How It Works:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start from a chosen point (source) and give it a distance of zero.</li>
                        <li>All other points start with an infinite distance (since we don‚Äôt know how far they are yet).</li>
                        <li>Visit the nearest unvisited point and update distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the process until all points have the shortest possible distance calculated.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>Applications of Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>üöó Finding the shortest driving routes in Google Maps and GPS systems.</li>
                        <li>üåç Network routing in the Internet to send data efficiently.</li>
                        <li>üéÆ Pathfinding for game AI to navigate maps.</li>

                    <h3>My project</h3>
                    <p>In this programming assignment, I built a solver using Djikstra's Algorithm for the 
                        <a href="https://www.bgames.com/game/flow-free-online/" target="_blank">Flow Free game</a>, 
                        a puzzle dating back to 1897 and popularized in Japan as Numberlink. The game 
                        involves connecting matching pairs of dots on a grid without overlapping paths. The 
                        assignment code was adapted from the open-source terminal version by
