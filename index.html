                <p> Hi! I am Himaja 😊—a passionate software engineer with a deep love for technology and innovation. 
                    On this website, you'll get to know a little about me and also explore the mother of all programming 
                    languages—C. This language holds a special place in my heart because I self-taught it during my 
                    master's, tackling various challenges along the way. Learning C not only strengthened my 
                    problem-solving skills but also deepened my understanding of algorithms and data structures, 
                    a fundamental pillar of computer science. </p>
                
                <h3>My Interests</h3>
                <p> Get to know me a bit better! The following are some of my interests: </p>

                <h2>My Journey in Tech</h2>
                <p> I moved to Melbourne 🦘in 2022 to pursue my Master of Software Engineering at the University of Melbourne. 
                    My passion for technology started back in school when I first discovered programming using C++. Initially,
                    though I was from a science background I enrolled in a business course after high school, thinking it was the 
                    path for me, but soon realized my true calling lay in the tech field. The challenge of programming and creating 
                    impactful solutions drew me in, so I switched to Information Technology. </p>

                <p>
                    During my final year, I had the opportunity to work with a small team to develop a smart parking Android application. 
                    The app used Bluetooth beacons to detect user locations and guide them to available parking spots. This project was a 
                    pivotal moment in my learning journey, teaching me the value of resilience, persistence, and dedication. 
                    These experiences motivated me to pursue my master's in software engineering, where I worked on a variety of projects 
                    involving UI/UX design, web development, and software principles—sometimes even collaborating with real clients.</p>

                <p>
                    Throughout my tech journey I also was part of 3 internships in total, two IT internships based in Dubai and one in Melbourne
                    as a full stack software developer. </p>
    
                <h2>Future Goals and Vision</h2>
                <p class="italic-line"> My Vision: Fix the potholes of today for a better tomorrow. </p>
                <p> I’m particularly passionate about building intuitive, user-friendly web applications that simplify people's lives 
                    and create a positive impact. I also want to learn and grow continuously to deep dive into some hot topics in 
                    tech field right now: AI, cybersecurity and cloud technologies such as AWS and Azure.
